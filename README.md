# Basic_Django_HOG

in the Pycharm terminal run python manage.py runserver
Go to 127.0.0.1:8000/videos to see the output
Go to 127.0.0.1:8000/admin to delete videos (user/pw is admin/cosc4397)

Do runserver first, go to the video page, then run HOG.py and when that's done refresh the webpage to see the changed output.
